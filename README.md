I coded it in one day to just compile basic spark codes so don't expect it to work perfectly. Switch-case and GOTO functions are missing. Also oneline if works with only math operators. <br><br>
Does not work like other compilers. This compiler interprets spark code to python code.<br><br>
Edit the code.sparks file and run the interpreter.py file. Also you can download the exe version of this compiler from [this download link](https://github.com/Hyloft/SparkCompiler/releases).
